In 1957, evil Brain Aliens have arrived on Earth in flying saucers
from Planet X. These aliens are abducting humans to be slaves for
The Giant Brain. The Otto Matics, righteous robots, are here to
save humanity. As Otto Matic, your mission is to rescue as many
humans as possible while defeating the Brain Aliens and their
followers. You'll travel to treacherous alien worlds in your rocket
ship, starting with Earth. Save humans while avoiding the Brain
Aliens' abduction attempts. Teleport the saved humans to your ship.
Once The Giant Brain is defeated and peace is restored, return to
Earth to free the rescued humans.

Released in 2001, Otto Matic was an iMac-exclusive bundled game.
