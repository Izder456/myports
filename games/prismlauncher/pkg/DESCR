Blockgame is a free, open source launcher for Minecraft. It allows you
to have multiple, cleanly separated instances of Minecraft (each with
their own mods, texture packs, saves, etc) and helps you manage them
and their associated options with a simple and powerful interface.

Blockgame is a fork of MultiMC: https://multimc.org.
