+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Minecraft and Java compatibility
================================

Starting with Minecraft 1.13, Minecraft recommends using newer
versions of the Java runtime instead of Java 1.8.

However, it is important to note that older versions of Minecraft
(especially with mods) will not play well with the latest version of
Java.

By default, ${PKGSTEM} is configured to play the latest version
of Minecraft (use games/lwjgl3 and devel/jdk%17 as runtime dependencies).

LWJGL2/3 Workaround
-------------------

By Default, ${PKGSTEM} attempts to use the lwjgl jar for linux. We do not want
that. So, instead, we can override it with launch arguments in the instance:

- For Minecraft <= 1.13.2

  You need games/lwjgl installed of course. 

  # pkg_add lwjgl

  Put this in the launch arguments:
  
  -Dorg.lwjgl.librarypath="${LOCALBASE}/share/lwjgl"

- For Minecraft > 1.13.2

  You need games/lwjgl3 installed of course.

  # pkg_add lwjgl3

  Put this in the launch arguments:

  -Dorg.lwjgl.librarypath="${LOCALBASE}/share/lwjgl3"

Running older versions of Minecraft
-----------------------------------

- For Minecraft <= 1.12.2, use Java 1.8 and make sure LWJGL 2 is
  installed.

  # pkg_add jdk%1.8 lwjgl

- While Minecraft 1.13 - 1.16.5 can run on newer versions, mod loaders
  are known to be broken on versions newer than 11:

  # pkg_add jdk%11

- Since Minecraft 1.17, it is required to use the latest version of
  Java.

  # pkg_add jdk

  (select latest when prompted)

Change Java installation for a Minecraft instance
-------------------------------------------------

1. Right click the instance and select "Edit Instance".
2. Go to "Settings" and click on "Auto-detect..." under "Java
   installation".
3. Select which version of Java you want to use.

Migrating from Blockgame to Prism Launcher
==========================================

To migrate your existing Blockgame instances to PrismLauncher, simply move
~/.local/share/Blockgame to ~/.local/share/PrismLauncher.

$ mv ~/.local/share/Blockgame ~/.local/share/PrismLauncher
