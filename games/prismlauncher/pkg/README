Minecraft and Java compatibility
================================

Starting with Minecraft 1.13, Minecraft recommends using newer
versions of the Java runtime instead of Java 1.8.

However, it is important to note that older versions of Minecraft
(especially with mods) will not play well with the latest version of
Java.

${PKGSTEM} also needs some extra handling to make lwjgl and lwjgl3 work. There
are a few scripts ${MAINTAINER} wrote up for fixing this.

Getting ${PKGSTEM} to launch with lwgjgl 
------------------------------------------

- For Minecraft <= 1.12.2, use Java 1.8 and make sure LWJGL 2 & 3 are
  installed.

  # pkg_add jdk%1.8 lwjgl lwjgl3

  Change the Java implementation to: 

  ${LOCALBASE}/share/PrismLauncher/runtimes/1.8.0

- While Minecraft 1.13 - 1.16.5 can run on newer versions, mod loaders
  are known to be broken on versions newer than 11: 

  # pkg_add jdk%11 lwjgl lwjgl3

  Change the Java installation to: 

  ${LOCALBASE}/share/PrismLauncher/runtimes/11

- For Minecraft 1.17 - 1.19.4, use Java 17 and make sure LWJGL 2 & 3 are
  installed.

  # pkg_add jdk%17 lwjgl lwjgl3

  Change the Java installation to:

  ${LOCALBASE}/share/PrismLauncher/runtimes/17

- For Minecraft > 1.19.4, use Java 21 and make sure LWJGL 2 & 3 are
  installed.

  # pkg_add jdk%17 lwjgl lwjgl3

  Change the Java installation to:

  ${LOCALBASE}/share/PrismLauncher/runtimes/21

Change Java installation for a Minecraft instance
-------------------------------------------------

1. Right click the instance and select "Edit Instance".
2. Go to "Settings" and click on "Auto-detect..." under "Java
   installation".
3. Select which version of Java you want to use.

Migrating from Blockgame to Prism Launcher
==========================================

To migrate your existing Blockgame instances to PrismLauncher, simply move
~/.local/share/Blockgame to ~/.local/share/PrismLauncher.

$ mv ~/.local/share/Blockgame ~/.local/share/PrismLauncher
