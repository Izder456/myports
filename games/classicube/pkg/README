| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program grabs game assets from the net upon first run to the
current working directory.

This port provides two executables, one a script and one a binary:

    ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/classicube/classicube_run
	the binary of the game engine itself.
	do not run this manually (keep reading)

    ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/classicube
	a wrapper script that opens classicube_run in a sane location
	so that the assets get saved to a user-writable location.
	the script opens & downloads assets to/from
	$HOME/.local/share/classicube
