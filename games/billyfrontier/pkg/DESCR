Billy Frontier is an arcade style action game with a "cowboys in
space" theme. You get to fight in duels, shootouts and stampedes.
It's the kind of game you'll want to pick up and play whenever you
get that twitch to just shoot something and blow stuff up!

Billy Frontier was released by Pangea Software for PowerPC Macs in
2003. This is a port of the game to modern operating systems, made
under permission from Pangea Software, Inc.
