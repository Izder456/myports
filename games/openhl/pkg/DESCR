This project is an attempt at the digital preservation of Half-Life.
The focus is not on features but instead to create a maintainable
codebase which can be easily ported to future POSIX platforms.

The goal is not necessarily to support as many platforms as possible,
but instead open / sane platforms that are accessible to people. I
don't plan to faff about with AppStore packaging systems. I also
don't plan to support any platform which does not provide a system
compiler.

The game data provided by this project is appropriate to distribute
and does not constitute piracy. The game data was made public by 
Valve and shared on popular services such as FilePlanet and magazine 
demo disks.

The original intention was probably to popularize their Steam DRM
platform but nonetheless, the data was made public. It is also
extracted using standard GCF tools (as distributed on Valve's
Developer Wiki). There has been no cracking involved. These publicly
distributable files are as follows:

  steaminstall_halflife.exe
   - Provides Half-Life
  steaminstall_opfor.exe
   - Provides Opposing Force
  steaminstall_full.exe
   - Provides Half-Life and Opposing Force
