In Cro-Mag Rally (CMR), you play as cavemen who race through different
ages in unique vehicles using primitive weapons. With single-player
and multiplayer modes, including Tag, Capture the Flag, and Survival,
up to four players can play on a single computer.

CMR, released in 2000 by Pangea Software, was a pack-in game on
Macs at the time. This is a port of the original OS 9 version,
authorized by Pangea Software, Inc. It offers an enhanced experience
with bug fixes and new features that stay true to the original game.
