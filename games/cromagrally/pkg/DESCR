Cro-Mag Rally is a racing game where players assume the role of
Brog, a caveman with a fondness for speed. Throughout the game,
Brog races through various historical periods, including the Stone,
Bronze, and Iron Ages, using an assortment of primitive vehicles
such as the Geode Cruiser, Bone Buggy, Logmobile, Trojan Horse, and
more. Alongside these vehicles, Brog also has access to a range of
primitive weapons, including Bone Bombs, Chinese Bottle Rockets,
and Heat Seeking Homing Pigeons.

The game offers single-player racing, where players compete against
computer-controlled opponents. Additionally, there are various
multiplayer modes available, such as Tag, Capture the Flag, and
Survival. These modes allow up to four players to compete on a
single computer in split-screen mode, adding to the excitement and
enjoyment.

This version of Cro-Mag Rally is a port of the original game released
by Pangea Software in 2000. With permission from Pangea Software,
Inc., this port has been created to offer players the best possible
experience of Cro-Mag Rally on modern computers. It is an enhanced
version that addresses some bugs from the original game while also
introducing a few new features that stay true to the spirit of the
game.
