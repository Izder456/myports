You are a dinosaur (a Nanosaur to be exact) from the future who has
traveled back in time to collect the eggs of 5 dinosaur species
before the giant asteroid hits the earth. The "primitive" dinosaurs
will attack you as you try to get their eggs, but just remember
that it's for their own good that you blast them into oblivion!

Being a dinosaur from the future, you are equipped with several
pieces of technology to help you in your mission.

    Fusion Blaster: a multi-purpose weapon for killing things.

    Jet Pack: For flying over things that might kill you.

    Temporal Compass: for finding time portals.

    GPS Locator: for figuring out where you are and where you should
    go.

You can jump, swim, run around, jet around, shoot stuff, etc. The
general rule to playing the game is "if it moves, kill it or it'll
kill you." You only have 20 minutes to collect all 5 egg species
so being efficient about your actions is critical.
