CAUTION

The use of this client can make your account terminated. The
possibility is really low, but still, use this port at your own
risk!

Abaddon tries its best (though is not perfect) to make Discord think
it's a legitimate web client. Some of the things done to do this
include: using a browser user agent, sending the same IDENTIFY
message that the official web client does, using API v9 endpoints
in all cases, and not using endpoints the web client does not
normally use. There are still a few smaller inconsistencies, however.
For example the web client sends lots of telemetry via the /science
endpoint (uBlock origin stops this) as well as in the headers of
all requests.

CONFIGURATION

abaddon.ini will also be automatically used if located at
~/.config/abaddon/abaddon.ini and there is no abaddon.ini in the
working directory

THE SPAM FILTER

Discord likes disabling accounts/forcing them to reset their passwords
if they think the user is a spam bot or potentially had their account
compromised. While the official client still often gets users caught
in the spam filter, third party clients tend to upset the spam
filter more often. If you get caught by it, you can usually appeal
it and get it restored. Here are some things you might want to do
with the official client instead if you are particularly afraid of
evoking the spam filter's wrath:

- Joining or leaving servers (usually main cause of getting caught)
- Frequently disconnecting and reconnecting
- Starting new DMs with people
- Managing your friends list
- Managing your user profile while connected to a third party client
