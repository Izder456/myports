EMWM is a fork of the Motif Window Manager with fixes and enhancements.
The idea behind this is to provide compatibility with current xorg
extensions and applications, without changing the way the window
manager looks and behaves. This includes support for multi-monitor
setups trough Xinerama/Xrandr, UFT-8 support with Xft fonts, and
overall better compatibility with software that requires Extended
Window Manager Hints.

Additionally a couple of goodies are available in the separate
utilities package: XmToolbox, a toolchest like application launcher,
which reads it's multi-level menu structure from a simple plain-text
file ~/.toolboxrc, and XmSm, a simple session manager that provides
session configuration, locking and shutdown/suspend options.

Note On MWM Compatibility

Initially EMWM used same configuration files and X resources as
MWM, this needed to change in order to avoid conflicts. Future
releases will only recognize Emwm class in X resources, mwmrc becomes
emwmrc also.
