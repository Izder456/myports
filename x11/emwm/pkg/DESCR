EMWM is a fork of the Motif Window Manager with fixes and enhancements.
The idea behind this is to provide compatibility with current xorg
extensions and applications, without changing the way the window
manager looks and behaves. This includes support for multi-monitor
setups through Xinerama/Xrandr, UTF-8 support with Xft fonts, and
overall better compatibility with software that requires Extended
Window Manager Hints.
