nxbelld is a tiny utility to aid people who either don't like the
default PC speaker beep, or use a sound driver that doesn't have
support for the PC speaker.

nxbelld performs a given action every time the X bell is rung.  The
actions nxbelld can currently perform include running a specified
program, emulating the PC speaker beep using your sound card
(default), or playing a PCM encoded WAVE file.
