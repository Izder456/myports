PLAYING AUDIO FILES:

    nxbelld can play PCM encoded WAVE files. If you want to do this,
    you can convert your favorite sound files to a PCM encoded WAVE file:

	ffmpeg -i <file> -vn -acodec pcm_s16le out.wav

THROTTLING:

    nxbelld can also throttle the bell if it is rung too often (e.g. some
    terminal program goes crazy), and/or disable the system's audible bell (so
    that you don't get the annoying PC speaker beep in addition to your
    nxbelld action).


INFO FOR SNDIO USE:

    When using sndio, the beeps are slightly shorter than the specified beep
    duration.  Beeps of 120ms or shorter don't get played at all.  This can be
    worked around simply by specifying a longer duration using the --duration
    option.
