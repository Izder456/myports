Fast and simple system info (for UNIX based operating systems)
written in POSIX compliant C99, that can be configured at compile
time by editing the src/config.h file. It uses the C Preprocessor
to implement config options at compile time.

afetch is written in C99, meaning that it should be able to be
compiled with almost all C compilers. As well as being written in
a very fast language, it's multithreaded. This makes it even faster,
as well as distinguishing it from similar programs written is POSIX
sh. The only limitations it has is the speed of your distros package
manager!
