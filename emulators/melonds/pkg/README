Caveat
=========

Unfortunately, MelonDS's JIT support, makes build fail on OpenBSD.
Because of this, JIT support is DISABLED for now.

Firmwares
=========

melonDS requires BIOS/firmware copies from a DS. Files required:

- bios7.bin, 16KB: ARM7 BIOS
- bios9.bin, 4KB: ARM9 BIOS
- firmware.bin, 128/256/512KB: firmware

Firmware boot requires a firmware dump from an original DS or DS Lite.
DS firmwares dumped from a DSi or 3DS aren't bootable and only contain
configuration data, thus they are only suitable when booting games
directly.
